## Property Booking Process Flowchart

### Process Description
The property booking process is one of the most critical workflows in the Airbnb Clone system. This flowchart illustrates the complete journey from property search to booking confirmation.

### Process Steps

#### 1. Property Search Phase
- **Start**: User initiates property search
- **Input**: Search criteria (location, dates, guests, filters)
- **Process**: System queries property database
- **Output**: Filtered property listings
- **Decision**: Are properties available?

#### 2. Property Selection Phase
- **Input**: User selects specific property
- **Process**: System loads property details
- **Output**: Comprehensive property information
- **Decision**: Does user want to proceed with booking?

#### 3. Date and Guest Selection
- **Input**: User selects check-in/check-out dates and guest count
- **Process**: System validates availability
- **Output**: Availability confirmation and pricing
- **Decision**: Are dates available and pricing acceptable?

#### 4. User Authentication
- **Input**: User login credentials
- **Process**: System authenticates user
- **Output**: Authentication token
- **Decision**: Is user authenticated?

#### 5. Booking Details Review
- **Input**: User reviews booking summary
- **Process**: System calculates total price
- **Output**: Final booking summary
- **Decision**: Does user confirm booking details?

#### 6. Payment Processing
- **Input**: Payment method and details
- **Process**: System processes payment via gateway
- **Output**: Payment confirmation
- **Decision**: Is payment successful?

#### 7. Booking Confirmation
- **Input**: Successful payment confirmation
- **Process**: System creates booking record
- **Output**: Booking confirmation and receipt
- **End**: Process complete

### Error Handling Points

#### Authentication Errors
- Invalid credentials → Return to login
- Account locked → Show lockout message
- Session expired → Redirect to login

#### Availability Errors
- Dates no longer available → Show alternative dates
- Property booked → Suggest similar properties
- Price changed → Show updated pricing

#### Payment Errors
- Payment declined → Retry payment
- Insufficient funds → Show payment error
- Gateway timeout → Retry transaction

### Success Path
1. User searches properties
2. User selects property and dates
3. User authenticates successfully
4. User confirms booking details
5. Payment processes successfully
6. Booking is confirmed
7. Confirmation emails are sent
8. Process completes successfully

### Alternative Paths
- **Guest Checkout**: Users can book without account creation
- **Instant Booking**: Some properties allow immediate booking
- **Request Booking**: Host approval required for some properties
