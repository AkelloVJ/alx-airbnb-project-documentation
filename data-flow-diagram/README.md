# Data Flow Diagram - Airbnb Clone System

## Overview
This document describes the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone system, illustrating how data moves through various processes, entities, and data stores.

## Data Flow Diagram Description

### External Entities
1. **Guest** - External user who books properties
2. **Host** - External user who lists properties
3. **Admin** - System administrator
4. **Payment Gateway** - External payment processing system
5. **Email Service** - External email delivery service
6. **SMS Service** - External SMS delivery service

### Data Stores
1. **Users Database** - Stores user account information
2. **Properties Database** - Stores property listings
3. **Bookings Database** - Stores booking information
4. **Payments Database** - Stores payment transactions
5. **Reviews Database** - Stores user reviews
6. **Messages Database** - Stores communication data
7. **System Logs** - Stores application logs

### Key Processes

#### Authentication Process
- **Input:** User credentials (email, password)
- **Process:** Validate credentials, generate JWT token
- **Output:** Authentication token, user profile data
- **Data Flow:** Guest/Host → Authentication Service → Users Database

#### Property Search Process
- **Input:** Search criteria (location, dates, filters)
- **Process:** Query properties database, apply filters
- **Output:** Filtered property listings
- **Data Flow:** Guest → Search Service → Properties Database → Guest

#### Booking Process
- **Input:** Property ID, dates, guest information
- **Process:** Check availability, create booking, process payment
- **Output:** Booking confirmation, payment receipt
- **Data Flow:** Guest → Booking Service → Bookings Database → Payment Gateway → Payments Database

#### Property Management Process
- **Input:** Property details, photos, pricing
- **Process:** Validate data, store property information
- **Output:** Property listing confirmation
- **Data Flow:** Host → Property Management Service → Properties Database

#### Review Process
- **Input:** Property rating, review text
- **Process:** Validate review, store data
- **Output:** Published review
- **Data Flow:** Guest → Review Service → Reviews Database

#### Messaging Process
- **Input:** Message content, recipient information
- **Process:** Store message, send notification
- **Output:** Message delivery confirmation
- **Data Flow:** Guest/Host → Messaging Service → Messages Database → Email/SMS Service

## Data Flow Patterns

### User Registration Flow
1. Guest/Host submits registration data
2. System validates input data
3. Password is hashed and stored
4. User account is created in Users Database
5. Welcome email is sent via Email Service
6. Registration confirmation is returned

### Property Booking Flow
1. Guest searches for properties
2. System queries Properties Database
3. Guest selects property and dates
4. System checks availability in Bookings Database
5. Guest provides payment information
6. Payment is processed via Payment Gateway
7. Booking is created in Bookings Database
8. Payment record is stored in Payments Database
9. Confirmation emails are sent to both parties
10. Booking confirmation is returned to guest

### Property Listing Flow
1. Host submits property details
2. System validates property information
3. Property is stored in Properties Database
4. Admin review notification is sent
5. Property listing confirmation is returned

### Review Submission Flow
1. Guest submits review after stay
2. System validates review data
3. Review is stored in Reviews Database
4. Property rating is updated
5. Host notification is sent
6. Review confirmation is returned

## Data Security Flows

### Authentication Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens are used for session management
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Failed login attempt tracking

### Payment Security
- Payment data is encrypted in transit
- PCI compliance for payment processing
- Secure tokenization of payment methods
- Audit trail for all transactions

### Data Privacy
- Personal data is encrypted at rest
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- User consent management
- Data retention policies

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed queries for fast property search
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Database connection pooling
- Query optimization for complex searches

### Caching Strategy
- Redis caching for property listings
- Session caching for user data
- Search result caching
- Static content caching

## Error Handling Flows

### Validation Errors
- Input validation at API level
- Database constraint validation
- Business rule validation
- Error response formatting

### System Errors
- Graceful error handling
- Error logging to System Logs
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback mechanisms

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Data Collection
- User behavior tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring
- Business metrics tracking

### Reporting
- Booking analytics
- Revenue reporting
- User engagement metrics
- System performance reports
